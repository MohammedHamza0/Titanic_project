Titanic classfication project to predict the poeple whose are survived or died 

Titanic Dataset Analysis
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, exploring the demographics and passenger information from the historic voyage of the RMS Titanic. The analysis involves examining survival rates, predicting survival using machine learning algorithms, and uncovering insights from the data.



Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset and gain insights into factors influencing survival rates. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and machine learning models are employed to understand patterns and predict survival probabilities based on passenger attributes.

Dataset
The dataset used for analysis comprises various features including passenger demographics, ticket information, cabin details, and survival outcomes. Key columns include:

PassengerId,
Survived,
Pclass,
Name,
Sex,
Age,
SibSp,
Parch,
Ticket,
Fare,
Cabin,
Embarked,
Analysis,
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Initial exploration involves:

Data cleaning and preprocessing,
Statistical summaries,
Visualizations (histograms, pie charts, etc.),
Correlation analysis,

Machine Learning Models
Predictive models are implemented using machine learning algorithms such as:

Decision Trees,
Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting,
XGboost,
Voting
